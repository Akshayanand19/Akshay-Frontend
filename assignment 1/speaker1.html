    <p>*Ujjwal Chaurasia, better known online as Techno Gamerz, is one of India's most prominent gaming YouTubers. He is most known for his GTA V gameplay series.



        He has always loved video games and has played them since he was a young child. "Snowbros," which he used to play at his brother's house, was the first video game he had played. On August 13, 2017, Ujjwal launched his YouTube channel. He primarily shared instructional videos for video games.
        
        
        
        On his brother's advice, Ujjwal began concentrating on YouTube. He launched a brand-new gaming and technology channel. He gave this channel the apparent moniker of Techno Gamers.
        
        
        
        Ujjwal then improved the caliber of his gaming videos. When one of Ujjwal's videos went viral, his perseverance paid off. The video that attracted a lot of views for him was a guide for downloading the game "Dragon Ball Z Xenoverse."</p>
